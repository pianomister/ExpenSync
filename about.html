            Track your expenses anywhere, on any device, and synchronize them using Dropbox.

          <p>
            ExpenSync is designed to make it as <strong>easy and time-saving</strong> as possible to track expenses.
            Add new expenses quickly in the app's start screen &ndash; just the price is mandatory, so
            if you are in a hurry, you are not forced to fill in everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Customize the categories</strong> you want to track, add new categories with custom icons and disable categories you don't need.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Synchronize and backup your expenses</strong> in the cloud, using your existing Dropbox account.
            Add expenses anywhere on your mobile device, synchronize and you'll have them on your computer!
